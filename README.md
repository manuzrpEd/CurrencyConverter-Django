# CurrencyConverter

The following is a coding challenge. I intend to build an API that allows end-users to convert one amount from one currency to another. I will simply reference this API from my front end:

http://api.currencylayer.com/

Using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)'s Python web framework, I will expose the API functionality to users. Users should be able to select a source currency, enter an amount and select a destination currency. The app should then convert the amount to the destination currency and display the converted amount.

My solution can be found in the following website: https://simplecurrency.onrender.com
