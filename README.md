# Currency Converter - Code Challenge

The following is a coding challenge. I intend to build an API that allows end-users to convert one amount from one currency to another. I will simply reference this API from my front end:

http://api.currencylayer.com/

Using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)'s Python web framework, I will expose the API functionality to users. Users should be able to select a source currency, enter an amount and select a destination currency. The app should then convert the amount to the destination currency and display the converted amount.

My solution can be found in the following website: https://simplecurrency.onrender.com

# Steps of my code solution

On Windows 11, open the command prompt and move to a directory where we will create our virtual environment (a bunch of directories and files). We create the folder, navigate into the folder and create the virtual environment in the following way:
```
mkdir currency
cd currency
python3 -m venv myvenv
```
